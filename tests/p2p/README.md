## Test application for P2P Layer
This is a test application for end to end testing of P2P layer library. This is a very simple app, that instantiates the P2P layer and connects with another peer on network running with same protocol/network. Goal is to test the peer discovery and peer connection.

Build and run the application as following:

#### build an instance

```
go build
```

#### run first instances

```
./p2p config1.json
```

#### run second instance from a different terminal

```
./p2p config2.json
```
#### let the two instances discover and connect with each other

```
